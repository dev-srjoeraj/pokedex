# Pokedex
A simple Pokedex made using the PokeApi made in Android Studio using Java.<br>
I created this application to learn a bit on Retrofit , Glide and RecyclerViews.<br>
The app does not has pagination enabled.<br>
I will try to add that ASAP<br>

 <b>Homepage with the list of all the Pokemons. </b><br><br>
